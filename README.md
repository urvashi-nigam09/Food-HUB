Food Hub is a modern and responsive e-commerce website dedicated to offering a wide variety of food items at reasonable prices. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this website allows users to explore and purchase food products effortlessly. The development of Food Hub focused on providing a smooth and engaging user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

The website's structure is created using HTML5, which ensures semantic and well-organized content. Each section, including the product catalog, product details pages, and user authentication pages, is meticulously crafted to provide a seamless browsing experience.

CSS3 is used to style the website, giving it a visually appealing and consistent look. Custom styles combined with Bootstrap's pre-built classes ensure that the design is both modern and responsive. The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, making the website accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. It handles various functionalities such as form validation, search filters, and the shopping cart system. By utilizing JavaScript, the website provides a more interactive and user-friendly experience.

Bootstrap 4 is leveraged for its responsive design capabilities and pre-built components.
